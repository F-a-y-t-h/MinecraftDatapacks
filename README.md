Modconflicts

Terralith - extremely invasive world gen; only good for vanila+ types (pixelmon?); really good looking however...
Biomes of plenty - bloated world gen; makes it hard to find anything of value


mod ban list
pick_up_torches - messes with right click on all blocks
guifollowers - massive fps drops
chococraft v4 - sound effect dont fit well
Resource Chickens - replaces the basic chicken by default pretending other mods adding features to it
TaxFreeLevels - no configuration for setting makes it not play well with easy anvil
CapsuleCorp - clunky usage; should really rework to use the bundle system
FuelCanister - need to be blacklisted from many omni-'repair' mods; can be completely consumed by many mods; (todo; check if manually adding it to immersive_aircraft's fuel lists will work correctly)
